(* A type environment maps term variables to types in de Bruijn's representation. *)

(* Our term variables are in nominal representation, which allows us to represent
   the environment as a binary search tree. One difficulty is that when we enter a
   new type variable binder [TyAbs], we must (conceptually) shift every type in
   the range of the environment up by one. When term variables are in de Bruijn
   notation and the environment is a list, this is easily done by inserting a mark
   in front of the environment. Here, we must be more clever. We maintain an [N2DB]
   environment that tells us, for every *term* variable, how long ago it was bound,
   that is, how many *type* variables were introduced since then. Hence, this tells
   us by how much we must shift its type. It's really a bit too clever, but let's
   do this for fun. *)

(* An equality test. *)

(* In the absence of recursive types, syntactic equality would work. However,
   in their presence, one must unfold recursive types during the equality
   check. *)

(* Note that comparing two [TyMu] types just by comparing their bodies is
   correct, but incomplete. We do not do it. Naively unfolding every [TyMu]
   type is complete, but leads to potential non-termination. We do that, with
   a budget limit, which makes the algorithm unsound (two types may be
   considered equal when they are different). I should really implement
   my own algorithm (Gauthier & Pottier, ICFP 2004) but that will be for
   some other time. *)
