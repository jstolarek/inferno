(* This module offers the traditional, low-level presentation of a constraint
   solver: a definition of the syntax of constraints and a function [solve],
   which solves a constraint and annotates it, so as to publish information
   that can be exploited in the reconstruction phase. *)

  | CConj of rawco * rawco

    (* An equation between two types, represented by two unifier variables,
       [v1] and [v2]. These variables must have been correctly bound via
       [CExist] or by [CLet]. *)

       must have been created fresh. *)
  | CExist of variable * rawco

    (* An application of a constraint abstraction, [x w [witnesses?]]. The term
       variable refers to a constraint abstraction (in other words, a type
       scheme) that has been defined earlier via [CDef] or [CLet]. This
       abstraction is applied to the type variable [w] (in other words, [w] must
       be an instance of this type scheme). The argument [witnesses] must be a
       fresh write-once reference, which the solver will set to a list of
       witnesses. This list indicates how the type scheme was instantiated. *)

       is bound to the constraint abstraction [\v.C1], and the write-once
       reference [s?] is filled with a type scheme that represents a simplified
       form of this constraint abstraction. The environment is extended with
       all of these new bindings when [C2] is examined. The write-once reference
       [vs?] is filled with a list of type variables that must be universally
       quantified in the left-hand side of the [let] construct so as to be in
       scope when [C1] is decoded. *)

     the constraint. *)
