(* This module implements a transactional variant of the union-find
   algorithm. It uses transactional references instead of ordinary
   references, so that a series of operations performed within a
   transaction can be either committed or rolled back. *)

(* See [UnionFind] for a description of the operations. As far as the
   user is concerned, the only difference in the API is that [union]
   requires a transaction parameter. A transaction can be created by
   [TRef.tentatively]. *)
