(* This module implements a transactional variant of the union-find
   algorithm. It uses transactional references instead of ordinary
   references, so that a series of operations performed within a
   transaction can be either committed or rolled back. *)

(* See [UnionFind] for comparison. The differences are:
   - we use [TRef.cell] instead of [ref];
   - [find] does not perform path compression, so as to avoid
     requiring a transaction parameter;
   - [union] requires a transaction parameter. *)

(* TEMPORARY offer a version of [find] that performs path compression
   and must be used outside a transaction? would be useful when we
   walk the unification graph. *)
