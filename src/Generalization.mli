open UnifierSig

(* This module takes care of creating and instantiating type schemes. It is
   parameterized over the type structure and over a unifier. *)

module Make (S : STRUCTURE) (U : UNIFIER with type 'a structure = 'a S.structure) : sig

  (* A variable is just a unifier variable. *)

  open U

  (* The literature defines a type scheme as a type (the ``body''), placed in
     the scope of a list of universal quantifiers. Here, the quantifiers are
     just variables (which definitely carry no structure), while the body is
     just a variable too (which possibly/probably carries some structure).
     One may think of a type scheme as a fragment of the unification graph,
     part of which is marked ``generic'' and is meant to be copied when the
     type scheme is instantiated, part of which is not (the free variables, so
     to speak). *)

  type scheme

  val quantifiers: scheme -> variable list
  val body:        scheme -> variable

  (* We maintain a piece of private state, which can be abstractly thought of
     as a representation of a constraint context of the following form:

     cctx := hole
     | cctx[let exists vs. hole in ...]

     That is, a context is either 1- just a hole; or 2- a hole, nested in a
     [CExist] construct, nested in the left-hand side of a [CLet] construct,
     itself nested in another context. (The variables [vs] are type variables;
     [...] stands for a constraint, which is irrelevant here.) In short, the
     state keeps track of how many [CLet] constructs have been entered (in the
     left-hand side) and keeps track of the variables that are existentially
     bound at each such construct.

     The state of the unifier is logically placed in this hole. Let us write
     [U] for a unifier state (that is, a unification constraint in solved
     form). When a unifier state [U] and a state of this module [cctx] are
     combined, the constraint [U] is logically placed in the hole of the
     context [cctx], i.e., the meaning of the combination is [cctx[U]].

     This state is mutable. *)

  type state

  (* A debugging utility. *)

  val show_state: string -> state -> unit

  (* The initial state corresponds to the empty constraint context. *)

  val init : unit -> state

  (* We manage the rank information carried by every unification variable. The
     details are abstract. Suffice it to say that the user is expected to set
     the rank of a freshly created variable to [no_rank]. The user is also
     expected to register every freshly created variable with us, using the
     function [register]. This updates the state (as well as the variable's
     rank) by recording that this variable is bound at the most recent [CLet]
     construct. (Note: [register] can be called only if the current context
     is nonempty, i.e., the current [enter]/[exit] balance is at least one.) *)

  val no_rank: int
  val register: state -> variable -> unit

  (* A variable can be turned into a trivial scheme, with no quantifiers and
     no generic part: in other words, a monomorphic type scheme. Non-trivial
     type schemes are created by the functions [enter] and [exit] below. *)

  val trivial: variable -> scheme

  (* [enter] updates the current state by pushing a new [CLet] construct. The
     the hole is replaced with [let exists vs. hole in ...], where the list
     [vs] of young variables is empty. This function is used when entering the
     left-hand side of a [let] construct. *)

  val enter: state -> unit

  (* [exit] updates the current state by popping a [CLet] construct. This
     involves an inspection of the unifier state. The most recent [CLet]
     construct, combined with the unifier state, takes the form [let exist
     vs.U in ...]. The state [U] is inspected. (An occurs check is optionally
     performed at this point, so [U.Cycle] may be raised.) This allows some of
     the variables in the list [vs] to be deemed ``non-generalizable''; their
     existential quantifiers are hoisted out. The remaining variables in [vs]
     are deemed ``generalizable''. The user may provide a list of roots
     (variables) that she is interested in; each of these roots in turned into
     a type scheme.

     In summary, if [rectypes] is a Boolean flag that indicates whether
     recursive types should be allowed, if [state] is the current state, if
     [roots] is a list of roots of interest, then, after the call:

     let vs, schemes = exit rectypes state roots in
     ...

     [state] is updated, and [vs] is a list of the structureless generalizable
     variables, and [schemes] is a list of type schemes, in correspondence
     with the list [roots]. For each such root and scheme, the scheme's body
     is this root, and the scheme's quantifiers are the structureless
     generalizable variables that are reachable from this root. Hence, the
     scheme's quantifiers form a subset of [vs]. (Not a sublist. A subset.) *)

  (* The complexity of this operation is linear in the size of the young
     generation (i.e., the number of variables that were created since [enter]
     was last called) plus the length of the list [roots] plus the current
     nesting depth of [CLet] constructs (usually considered a constant). *)

  val exit: bool -> state -> variable list -> variable list * scheme list

  (* [instantiate] takes a fresh copy of a type scheme. The generic variables
     of the type scheme are replaced with freshly created variables, which are
     automatically registered (hence, the current state is updated). The function
     returns the (fresh) instances of the scheme's quantifiers (in the same order
     as the list returned by the function [quantifiers]) as well as the instance
     of the body. *)

  (* The complexity of this operation is linear in the size of the generic part
     of the type scheme. *)

  val instantiate: state -> scheme -> variable list * variable
